# Installation steps/Prerequisite
  - Visual Studio/VS Code 
  - .Net Core 3.1

# Build and Run
  - Simply build and run the project with Visual Studio and it'll load all the depencies
  - I've made it interactive. So, it'll ask for input, choose as per your choice
 
# Running Test Cases & Testing considerations
 - To run test cases use Resharper or Visual Studio Test Explore
 - Usually I do lot of unit test and try to give at least 80% test coverage but for the time I've written only one class complete test cases
 - Also, to adhere automated testing I write BDDs
 
 # What would I've done differently if I had more time
 - I've tried my best to complete the assessment but if I would have more time then I would have thought of different design or alternate design
 - would have thought of making more generic
 - would have focusedon writing more test cases
 - would have thoght of making more interactive UI
 - also, I would have considered for configurable things, logging and better exception handling
 - Most important, also I would have attached this project on github with Azure devops to support CI/CD. Same I've alredy done with my other project.
